RADIATION

===================================

Characters can have from 0 to 1000 rads
Vault Dwellers are aware of precise rad count
Wastelanders know about how much (200, 400, 600, 800..)

===================================

RAD RESISTANCE

Radiation Resistance capped at 85%
Initial % = Endurance x 2
ANTI_RADIATION perk = Flat 25%
Note: the medicine skill ranges from 10 to 100. Our first aid skill goes from 0 to 5.
Rad-x = 30% + ((medicine - 10) / 2). For our system, possibly 25% + (first aid * 10%)?
Rad-Away = -60 - (medicine - 10) radiation. For our system, possibly -50 - (first aid * 20)?
Power Armor: 10%
Environmental Armor: 30%
